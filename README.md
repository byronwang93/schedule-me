A scheduling project for nwPlus hackathons.

Created by the nwPlus HackCamp 2023-2024 team :)

TODOs for the future:
- adding stats about each individual person (total number of shifts, when they were scheduled during their unavailability, what shifts, etc)
- adding an option to go back (or a save + load feature)
- adding an option to recalculate shifts
