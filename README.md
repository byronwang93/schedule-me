A scheduling project for nwPlus hackathons.

Created by the nwPlus HackCamp 2023-2024 team :)

Supports:
- Providing a base shift schedule for hackathon organizers
- Provides summary of stats for each organizer, including how many shifts they were shifted for and when they were scheduled incorrectly (GPT makes mistakes sometimes :P)

TODOs for the future:
- adding an option to go back (or a save + load feature)
- fixing prompt engineering to get better results (since GPT can give spotty answers)
- saving on refresh
